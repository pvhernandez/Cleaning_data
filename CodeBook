#Code Book
Here you can find th description of the variables, the data and the transformation of work we performed to get the tidy data.

First you have to download the files to your working directory.

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

##run_analysis.R features

####1. Read the data from files and stores in variables with the same name:
    - features.txt
    - activity_labels.txt
    - subject_train.txt
    - x_train.txt
    - y_train.txt
    - subject_test.txt
    - x_test.txt
    - y_test.txt
    


####2. Assign column names to the data imported in 1 

####3. In testData we merge x_test, y_test and subject_test

####4. Create final data stored in finalData merging trainingData and testData

####5. Now extract only the measurements on the mean an standard deviation for each
        Create a logical vector that contains TRUE values for the ID,mean and stddev columns and FALSE for the others.
        
####6. Use descriptive activity names for the activities in the data set and merge with the activityType table that contains activity names.

####7.Label de data set with descriptive names.
        Use the gsub() function for replacement an clean up the data labels.
        
####8. Create a second indipendent and tidy data set with the average of each variable.



    In the script you can find more descriptions in the proper place.
