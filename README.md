Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project

#Porpouse of the project

We have to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
Get the data collected from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone
from the link :

You can get a description of the data from:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

What we will do is create a script called ### run_analysis.R ### that does the following:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. We will call it ### tidyData.txt ###
